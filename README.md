# Chartlets - Tiny charts for tablet and mobile web apps (Enhanced)

Chartlets are tiny charts without grids or legends, like [Sparklines][1]. They're 
perfect for conveying simple relationships or trends, especially when space is scarce.

See examples and documentation at [awahab07.github.io/chartlets][2].
